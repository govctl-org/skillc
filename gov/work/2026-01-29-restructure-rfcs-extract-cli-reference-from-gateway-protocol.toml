description = "Restructure RFCs to extract cross-cutting CLI concerns from [[RFC-0002]] (Gateway Protocol) into [[RFC-0007]] (CLI Reference). This creates a cleaner separation: [[RFC-0002]] focuses on gateway commands (outline, show, open, sources), while [[RFC-0007]] owns the command registry, skill resolution, access logging, sync, and MCP interface."
