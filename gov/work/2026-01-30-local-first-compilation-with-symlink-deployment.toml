description = """
Implement local-first compilation where compiled skills live in .skillc/runtime/ (SSOT)
and agent directories contain symlinks (or junctions/copies on Windows) pointing to the SSOT.

Key changes:
- Build outputs to SSOT location (.skillc/runtime/ or ~/.skillc/runtime/)
- Deploys to agent directories via symlink by default
- --global flag forces global SSOT
- --target specifies which agents to deploy to (default: claude)
- --copy flag forces copy instead of symlink"""
