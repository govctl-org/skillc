Observability unlocks iteration**\nYou can't improve what you can't measure. Instrumented access is the foundation for data-driven skill refinement.\n\n**3. Progressive disclosure by default**\nThe spec recommends it; skillc enforces it. Compiled stubs expose structure without dumping content.\n\n**4. Local-first, zero infrastructure**\nskillc runs on your machine. Skills are files. No accounts, no network, no vendor lock-in.\n\n**5. Minimal viable tooling**\nStart with the smallest useful toolkit. Add capabilities only when clearly needed.",
