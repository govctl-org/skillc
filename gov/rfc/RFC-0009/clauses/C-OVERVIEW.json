Most behavior is convention-based with CLI overrides for per-invocation choices. Config files are reserved for true preferences that rarely change but need project-level control.\n\n**v0.1.0 Scope:**\n- Tokenizer preference for search indexing (ASCII vs CJK)\n\n**Future Extensions (planned):**\n- Lint rule enable/disable per [[RFC-0008]]",
