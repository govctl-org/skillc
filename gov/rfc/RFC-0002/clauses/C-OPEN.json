It can retrieve any file within the skill source directory. This enables retrieval of search results from non-`.md` files (e.g., `.txt`).\n\n**Path safety:**\nThe command MUST reject any path that would resolve outside the skill source directory after canonicalization. See [[RFC-0005:C-CODES]] for error E012.\n\n**No match:**\nIf the file does not exist, the command MUST exit with error E021 per [[RFC-0005:C-CODES]].",
