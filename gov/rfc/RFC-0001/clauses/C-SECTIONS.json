(N more)\" indicator\n\nThe first H1 is NOT treated specially — it is included like any other H1.\n\n## Other Markdown Files\n\nFor all other `.md` files in the skill directory:\n- Group all entries under a \"References\" label at indent level 0\n- Use the first H1 heading from each file at indent level 1\n- If a file has no H1 heading, use the relative file path as the label\n- Limit to 15 entries; if more exist, append \"... (N more)\" indicator\n- Files are listed in alphabetical order by path\n\nThe \"References\" section is only included if there are other `.md` files.\n\n## File Ordering\n\nFiles MUST be processed in this order:\n1. `SKILL.md` first (main document)\n2. Other `.md` files in alphabetical order by path\n\n## Example Output\n\n```\n## Top Sections\n\n- Rust CLI\n  - Default Flow\n  - Decision Tree\n- Advanced Topics\n  - Performance\n- References\n  - Clap Patterns\n  - Error Handling\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- \"Rust CLI\" and \"Advanced Topics\" are H1s from `SKILL.md`\n- \"Default Flow\", \"Decision Tree\", \"Performance\" are H2s from `SKILL.md`\n- \"References\" is the fixed grouping label\n- \"Clap Patterns\", \"Error Handling\" are H1s from other files\n\n*Since: v0.2.0*",
