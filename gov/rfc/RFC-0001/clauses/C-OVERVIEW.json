A **stub** — a compact `SKILL.md` that instructs agents to use gateway commands\n2. A **manifest** — metadata for build tracking and change detection\n\nCompilation enforces progressive disclosure: the stub exposes structure without content, directing agents to retrieve sections on-demand through skillc.",
